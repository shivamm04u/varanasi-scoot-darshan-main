You are building a PRODUCTION-READY full-stack tourism website with ADVANCED features. Follow these EXACT specifications:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 PROJECT IDENTITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROJECT NAME: Baba Banarasi – Solo Scooter Darshan

BRAND TAGLINE: "Don't just see Banaras, feel it."

REFERENCE WEBSITE (for visual design): https://varanasi-scoot-darshan.lovable.app/ 

TECH STACK: React + Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Supabase Auth + Edge Functions

PURPOSE: Build a complete, deployable website with frontend + backend + admin panel + database

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 FRONTEND DESIGN RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
Frontend design MUST be a PIXEL-PERFECT clone of: https://varanasi-scoot-darshan.lovable.app/ 

DO NOT CHANGE:
❌ Layout, structure, or sections
❌ Colors, gradients, backgrounds
❌ Fonts, typography, text sizes
❌ Images, photos, illustrations, posters
❌ Button styles, card designs
❌ Spacing, padding, margins
❌ Navigation structure
❌ Footer design
❌ Mobile responsive breakpoints

ONLY MAKE DYNAMIC:
✅ Text content (pulled from Supabase database)
✅ Contact information (editable via admin)
✅ Tour details (managed via admin panel)
✅ Pricing (admin-editable)
✅ Customer reviews (dynamic from database)

BUT MUST ADD THESE ENHANCEMENTS:
✅ Parallax scrolling effects (on hero section, place images, testimonials)
✅ Smooth scroll animations (Framer Motion)
✅ Interactive place cards with hover effects
✅ Image lazy loading with blur-up effect
✅ Testimonials/reviews section with carousel
✅ Public review submission feature
✅ Enhanced animations (same style as reference but smoother)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎨 PARALLAX SCROLLING IMPLEMENTATION (CRITICAL NEW FEATURE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PARALLAX EFFECTS REQUIRED:

1. HERO SECTION PARALLAX:
   - Background image scrolls slower than foreground content
   - Use Framer Motion or react-parallax library
   - Speed: background moves at 50% scroll speed
   - Text elements fade in with different speeds (layered effect)
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     import { Parallax } from 'react-parallax';
     
     <Parallax
       bgImage="/hero-varanasi-ghat.jpg"
       strength={500}
       bgImageStyle={{ opacity: 0.7 }}
     >
       <div style={{ height: '100vh' }}>
         {/* Hero content */}
       </div>
     </Parallax>
     ```

2. PLACES SECTION PARALLAX:
   - Each place card image has subtle parallax on scroll
   - Card container moves at normal speed
   - Image inside moves at 70% speed (creates depth)
   - Use intersection observer for performance
   - Only animate when card is in viewport

3. TESTIMONIALS PARALLAX:
   - Background pattern/texture scrolls slower
   - Review cards have slight floating animation
   - Avatar images have subtle zoom on scroll

4. STATS/NUMBERS SECTION:
   - Background moves slower
   - Number counters animate up when scrolled into view
   - Icons have bounce effect on appear

5. FOOTER PARALLAX:
   - Subtle background movement
   - Smooth fade-in of elements

LIBRARIES TO USE:
✅ react-parallax (for background parallax)
✅ Framer Motion (for scroll animations)
✅ react-intersection-observer (for triggering animations)

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
✅ Use will-change CSS property
✅ RequestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling
✅ Disable parallax on mobile (use media queries)
✅ Lazy load images with IntersectionObserver
